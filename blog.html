                    <p><strong>Max Verstappen took his first victory in any format since the 
                        Spanish Grand Prix way back in June after winning the Sprint at the Circuit of 
                        The Americas – giving the Dutchman hope that Red Bull have returned to competitiveness.</strong></p>

                        <h3>Key Moments</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Verstappen takes Sprint Qualifying pole</li>
                            <li>Verstappen wins Sprint</li>

                    <p>Red Bull arrived in Austin for the United States Grand Prix weekend with an upgrade package for the RB20, 
                        with Verstappen using it to good effect to claim Sprint Qualifying pole on Friday evening.</p>
                    <p>But he followed that up with a controlled display in the Sprint itself, withstanding early 
                        pressure from title rival Lando Norris to take the win – as Norris was 
                        passed on the final lap by Ferrari’s Carlos Sainz, meaning Verstappen extended his gap to the 
                        Briton to 54 points.</p>
                    <p>“It was not too bad, feels a bit like old times!” said Verstappen, who’s now won 11 of the 16 Sprints held.</p>

                    <p>Introduction to Responsive Design</p>
                    <p>Responsive design allows a website to adapt to various screen sizes and devices, ensuring that users have an optimal viewing experience on desktops, tablets, and smartphones. This approach enhances user experience, accessibility, and SEO.</p>

                    <p>Core Components of Responsive Design</p>
                    <p>Viewport Meta Tag: This tag defines how the browser displays the page across different devices by adjusting the layout according to the screen size.</p>
                    <p>Fluid Grids: Fluid grids use relative units like percentages instead of fixed-width units, allowing layouts to resize and adapt to different screen resolutions.</p>

                    <p>Using Media Queries for Device-Specific Styling</p>
                    <p>CSS media queries apply different styles based on device properties, like screen width or orientation. For example, media queries can change a website's layout or font size for mobile screens, enhancing the user experience across devices.</p>

                    <p>CSS Flexbox: A Modern Approach to Layout</p>
                    <p>Flexbox is a powerful CSS layout model that makes it easy to arrange elements within a container. Key properties include:</p>
                    <ul>
                         <li><strong>Flex-Direction:</strong> Defines the primary direction for the items, such as horizontal (row) or vertical (column).</li>
                         <li><strong>Wrap:</strong> Controls whether items should wrap onto new lines if they exceed the container’s size.</li>
                         <li><strong>Order:</strong> Allows you to rearrange the visual order of items without changing the HTML.</li>
                         <li><strong>Basis:</strong> Sets an initial size for items, helping to maintain consistency while adapting to screen changes.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Flexbox is useful for responsive design as it makes it easy to center, align, and space items flexibly within containers, helping web pages look great across different devices.</p>

                    <p>CSS Specificity: Understanding Style Priority</p>
                    <p>CSS specificity dictates which styles are applied when multiple rules target the same element. The specificity hierarchy prioritizes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Inline Styles:</strong> These have the highest priority, overriding other selectors.</li>
                        <li><strong>IDs:</strong> Ranked high in specificity, ID selectors apply strong styling.</li>
                        <li><strong>Classes and Attribute Selectors:</strong> Medium priority, used for styling groups of elements.</li>
                        <li><strong>Elements and Pseudo-Elements:</strong> Lowest priority, usually for basic styling.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <p>Understanding specificity helps avoid unexpected styling issues, ensuring that intended styles apply consistently.</p>

                    <p>CSS Gradients for Visual Appeal</p>
                    <p>CSS gradients add smooth color transitions, enhancing the visual design without requiring images. There are two main types:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Linear Gradients:</strong> Colors transition in a straight line, often used for backgrounds.</li>
                        <li><strong>Radial Gradients:</strong> Colors transition from a central point outward in a circular or elliptical pattern.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Gradients can be angled or directed for different effects, allowing designers to create visually engaging, dynamic backgrounds easily.</p>
